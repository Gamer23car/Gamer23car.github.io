<h1>Tornages.</h1>
<! content of the story >
<p>How long ago was it? 40, 20, no, no. It was, roughly 12 years ago, that I found the secret lair hidden under grandpa&rsquo;s musty, moist and humid vegetable garden. As I walked around, I felt my sandals hitting the rocky path, mossy and wet to the touch, curve them making me feel unstable while balancing on them. I was pondering whether to stop and stare at the blossoming flowers or sit under the tree. I decided to sit under the tree, the damp grass wettening my dress and the sunlight-</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up, Subject: 44. Your memories are not real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha-t? Hu-hh, w-ait I&rsquo;m n-o-t a gi-rl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shivering from the cold of the room, I rubbed my hands to generate some heat.</p>
<p>The man standing across the room gave a cold hard stare, beaming me down with no emotion in his eyes. I could feel his stone-hard gaze, washing over me.</p>
<p>The man replied,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, you were placed here for a reason.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, i-is i-t poss-i-bl-e, to m-ayb-e ra-i-se the h-ea-t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Erm, sure, if it helps you snap out of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man walked over to a screen and gestured his hands like he was turning a knob, his hands suddenly were grasping a real knob, and as he retreated, the knob disappeared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright, 44. You are the only one who recovered. You are strong enough to save the world from it&rsquo;s torn state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? I mean, what is my name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hrm, let&rsquo;s see, I guess Anthony will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I suddenly felt myself changing, and I was fit with clothing that, I have never seen before. A green slightly ripped hoodie grasped around my chest and wrapped around my arms, cascading itself around, and tightened itself to fit me. Jeans began adjusting themselves for my body, and I felt myself getting lighter. The liquid around me faded and I was placed on the floor, dripping wet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;fHUAWugh, aGH!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A burst of hot air came out from the walls, drying me off instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome to the team, Anthony.&rdquo;</p>
