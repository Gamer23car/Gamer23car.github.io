<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Lenard walks in, eyes shifting towards the counter where Alice counts the
    change each passing day, usually.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    "Huh..?",
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    He fumbles out his glasses from his jacket pockets to take a better look.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    "Oh." She's not there, and everything seems oddly organized and tidy. Not a
    single gum wrapper can be seen anywhere.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    He shifts his weight over to his left leg and looks around the store,
    glancing around.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    "Alice? Are you there? I've got some news."
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    The smell of the cheap air freshener lingers in the air as he makes his way
    over to the backroom door, nudging it open with his elbow.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    "Alice?"
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Nothing. Nothing but absolute darkness. There's nobody else there but him in
    the gas station. Assuming she went back home, Lenard awkwardly makes his way
    towards the door, careful not to make much noise in the hopes nobody notices
    him. Unfortunately, that is not the case.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    "'Ey Lenard!, where ya headed?", a voice from behind bellows.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    He stomachs a disappointed look on his face and grimaces as he looks behind
    to find nobody else but Jack grinning at him.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    "Hey. Jack. I was headed back home, you see so I can't-", Jack cuts him off,
    "Whaddya you mean you're headed back home?"
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    "You see I thought the store was open by now, I don't think it is, so I'll
    be going back home now. I've got work to figure out."
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Jack raises an eyebrow, "No time for hangin’ out?? C'mon it'll be fun, I
    promise."
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    "Alright, but this better be quick. I really don't want to be out here all
    day."
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    "Is that so?", Jack lowers his eyebrows, closes his eyes and pouts his lips,
    "I thought you'd want to start making out with Alice!"
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Lenards eyebrows furrow, "Okay, knock it off man."
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    "Yeah, sorry man. Just I find your conversations with her kinda weird,
    y'know? Considering she's taken and all?", Jack retorts.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Lenard starts frowning, "Dude, no, I know that. I just wanted to be
    friends."
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Jack shrugs, "It just felt weird watching you guys talk, guess you're just
    unable to interact with women then, dunce."
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Lenard starts looking at Jack furiously, clearly fed up.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    "Okay, whatever, let's go, I've got this whole day planned out."
</p>
<br/>

<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    "It's been 2 goddamn hours, where the hell are we headed Jack?!" Lenard is
    clearly getting frustrated.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    "I swear to you, it was right… about here!" Jack points to the ground next
    to a patch of grass and spilled paint.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Lenard looks at Jack unenthusiastically, "Really? You dragged me to who even
    knows where to show me a patch of dirt? Real great of you Jack. Next time,
    tell me in advance; thanks."
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Lenard starts walking towards the bus stop when Jack grabs onto his left
    shoulder suddenly.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    "No. It's not just that. Look closely."
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Lenard walks over to the patch again, squats, and looks at it again.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    "I don't understand, this is literally just a patch of regular grass.”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Naw man, you’re looking at this in the wrong light. This is an opportunity,
    this is a new beginni-”, Lenard starts walking away.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Dude come on look, it’s not really about the paint and the grass there was
    a guy here I swear..!”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Oh really now, a guy? And you expect me to believe you after you decide to
    not only question the friendship me and Alice have but also drag me out here
    to make a fool of me???” Lenard sighs, “Okay, whatever, I’m already out
    here. Tell me your stupid story, I can probably explain this to my parents”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Okay, so I was walking right?”
</p>
<br/>

</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Where. The. Absolute. Hell. Were you?!”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Alice looks down with rage and joy as she picks up Mr. Fluffles.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Mr. Fluffles meows.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Aw, I can’t really stay mad at you. You’re just a little guy aren’t you?”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    She gets up, ruffling his fur as she goes to open the top right cabinet
    where she keeps Mr. Fluffles' food. She dusts off the bowl and begins to
    open the can. Mr. Fluffles meows and runs over enthusiastically. She fills
    up the bowl with food and places it down as she takes the other bowl and
    begins to fill it up with water.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Man Mr. Fluffles, you sure are a little dingus huh?” Her expression
    flattens as she looks over to her computer, displaying the pathetically
    empty document she was meant to fill up with an essay on colonial America,
    of which the past hours were filled with her just mindlessly staring at
    historical sites figuring out how to open the essay. How futile. Just li-
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Ah. Right.”
</p>

</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “So.”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    There is a deep cutting silence between the two. The air gently whistles
    amongst the leaves as they rustle about. Neither of them make a singular
    noise. Everything is quiet.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “... I’m sorry.”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “It’s alright.”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    One of them gets up, turns with gentle care and goes to switch off the light
    illuminating the room, hesitating before pulling the cord.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Good day. I hope we can address this.”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Me as well. I’d like to start getting back to business as usual.”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    As the second person attempts to make their way down the rusted and worn out
    unguarded staircase dimly illuminated by the cadence of a disrepaired street
    light, the other one lifts their hand and points towards the cord.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Oh, my apologies.”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    They head back towards the cord and yank it on, re-illuminating the damp and
    bleak room once more.

<p dir="ltr">
    “Your story is full of loose ends, what do you mean the guy had a ‘glowing
    hat’?”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Jack pulls on his own hair, “I swear to you, this is not at all what I’m
    trying to communicate.”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Lenard raises his eyebrows and lowers them again, once again lost in the
    idea as to abruptly end it here or listen to more of Jack’s tales. Either
    one doesn’t seem too appealing as his house is a full 2 hours away, and the
    fastest way back is by the bus, and of which he’d have to spend time next to
    Jack anyways to catch it. On that note, it has been an hour since the last
    bus.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Look man, my phone’s going to die soon. I just wanna go back home. I get
    you’re feeling frustrated but I just wanna go back home, I don’t really know
    why I should care about some guy.” he breathes in and continues, “I’ve stuck
    with your stories for this long. Longer than I usually do. I really hope you
    understand I wanna go back to messing about; not.. chasing whatever this
    is.”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Jack looks at the patch blankly, he knows what he’s said is the truth to an
    extent, but.. Lenard is right.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I just wanna figure out what the truth behind this place is, y’know?”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    "What the hell do you mean there being a truth?"
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">

</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Jack.”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Lenard shakes Jack lightly once again in the ruse to try and awaken him.
    It’s unfruitful giving how Jack’s currently deep in sleep.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “JACK!”, Lenard yells abruptly
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Jack's eyes bolt open faster than any rifle and he strikes up in a ninety
    degree angle faster than a lightning bolt, his heart is racing faster than
    the nightlife street racers. He’s awake.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “What!?..”, he exclaims
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    He calms down a little, not fully, “..what?”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    It’s been 3 hours is what I get told.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Jack and Lenard start making their way back home, confused by the fact they
    were dozing off in some empty building. They don’t know yet. They wouldn’t
    ever be able to conceive what hellscape they’d been placed in, not yet.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Meanwhile,
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">

</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “So. I’ve been told we’ve come to an affront?”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Continuing, they pick up their papers.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I’ve discussed with others as to the best way we can continue business,
    even if that means leaks to the outside world. If you’d-” <br/>
    <br/>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    One of the hooded men makes a slight nudge towards the table. Their eyes
    dart towards it to glance upon what’s been contemplated.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    I pause.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “What, exactly… are you trying to gesture..?”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    A gun is shot. It penetrates the person’s chest, leaving a gaping hole where
    blood and flesh ran like clockwork. Business must resume to what it was
    previously, even if that means eliminating the prior.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    One of them pulls the light chain downwards in a single hand movement.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    The meeting is over.
