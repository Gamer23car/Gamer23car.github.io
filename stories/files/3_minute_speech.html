</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Has anyone here opened a Nature Valley Oats and Honey bar? [Pause]
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    I hate crumbs.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    You know all those crumbs that come out, just ruin your whole eating space
    unless you’re ultra careful?
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    The second you open that packaging you just get a torrential flow of
    straight up crumbs, they just fly everywhere and get into every single nook
    and cranny of where you’ve decided to start eating. [Temporary]
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    However, the main thing is that you get a roughly quality bar that you can
    start eating away at: expending those few crumbs that don’t have any real
    impact on you particularly.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Sometimes people like to cherish those crumbs, but I don’t find myself
    caring much about them. We’ve gotten to enjoy the somewhat alright taste of
    a Nature Valley Oats and Honey bar, all two of those singularly wrapped
    grainy bars.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    If I end up dropping one of them though, right on the floor, it’s a shame
    but I wouldn’t want to bother with it again. I’m not gonna rebake it. I’m
    not gonna recook it to get all the disease out of it. For all I know, if I
    dropped it outside, I’ll let the rats take it home because there’s no way
    I’m ever picking that back up again.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    I’d just get a new one.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    [Pause]
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    It’s this mentality that fuels companies nowadays.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Many, [and I mean] many [of them] have spent a great deal of money and
    effort to eliminate the right to repair movements, their version of the
    crumbs. Apple themselves has been one of the leaders in doing this, making
    their phones so incredibly hard to replace that most of their older devices
    are essentially just e-waste when they break.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    The cost of repairing just tends to outweigh the price of getting a whole
    new device: a tactic copied by most of the industry outright. No matter
    where you turn it’s dealing with a robot or lengthy turnover times just to
    get a now essential product of your life replaced or repaired affordably.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    They’ve also started to get rid of the crumbs in their packaging, getting
    rid of charging bricks and even that dang headphone jack that nobody seems
    to care about anymore. Removing expandable storage just so you spend that
    extra bit of money on the larger model.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Things are just so disposable, that product features like Wi-Fi this or
    Smart App this or Bluetooth that and AI are just tag-lines to ship off the
    crap that they make without many people even noticing. When it comes to
    things that aren’t just related to being digital, it adds more failure
    points along with mechanical ones.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Why throw silicon into a device that just doesn’t need that? Not every
    single part of one’s life should be tracked by smart devices or automated by
    it.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    And hey, who knows why the hell someone would need a smart toaster, but
    shoot it exists too. Once that software support ends though, if there’s any
    bugs or issues with it, you’re out of luck.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    The FTC reports that 89% of smart devices manufactured failed to disclose
    how long they would be supported with their software.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    It isn’t just technology, it comes in the form of farming equipment used to
    bring food to your table from companies like John Deere and their outright
    anti-repair stance: preventing people responsible for harvesting food from
    being able to do so safely.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    It’s mentalities like this that are why e-waste is piling on, we are on
    track to hit 62 million tons of e-waste by 2030.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    It’s companies like Unilever, Nestle, Nabisco, General Mills, Mars, PepsiCo,
    Kraft Heinz and Tyson foods just slowly and surely reducing how much product
    you get. A term that’s thrown around quite a lot is shrinkflation, mainly
    just taking out more and more of the actual natural ingredients and
    replacing them with more processed and less of the actual product itself.
    Watering it down or taking out more of the quality ingredients for cheaper
    replacements.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    After all, they’re just shaving off the crumbs.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    [Pause]
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    [End]
