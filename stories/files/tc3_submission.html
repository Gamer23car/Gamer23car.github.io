        It was warm outside, the sun beaming down upon the melting chocolate
        hills, rumbling soda falls, and then me. A juggernaut trying their best
        to defeat the mad bunnies, running around crushing those to be found
        within their path. I’ve watched as my friends have died, lost forever,
        not much left to see from it. Well; it doesn’t matter anymore, I’ll
        eventually get remanufactured and forget all my vain, pain and demises.
        I’ve been stuck near a hospital, healing up for the next battle against
        the bunnies. I’ve heard they supposedly have begun researching nuclear
        silos, while us? We’re busy researching literally chicken scratch, we
        can barely afford a thing, not even a goddamn turret to take some hits
        for us. Our economy has gone to hell from the chocolate artilleries,
        blowing up things left and right. I’ve gone sick looking at candy; I’d
        rather starve then eat another fucking bite of this shit. Heh, what am I
        to say really-
    </p>

    <p dir="ltr">
        “Hey idiot, you gonna sit there and weep while we’re stuck battling or
        are you actually going to help us kill off some bunnies?” - Juggernaut
        ?? said. <br/>
        <br/>
        “Fine fine, I’ll come, say what happened to all our medics?”
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p dir="ltr">
        “Uhh, well see, a heavy soldier just decided to charge and ended up
        leaking the position of our medics to the bunny guys. Sooo, they’re
        dead.” - Juggernaut 42 said.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p dir="ltr">
        “Crap, do any of our allies have more..?”
    </p>
    <p dir="ltr">
        <br/>
        “Nope. None.”
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p dir="ltr">
        “Shoot, well this is bad, and what’s the total combined income?” <br/>
        <br/>
    </p>
    <p dir="ltr">
        “Uhhh, let me go ask…”
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p dir="ltr">
        Juggernaut 42 walked away, so now here we are. Stuck in the middle of
        possible demise while our leaders scramble plans to overtake the
        bunnies. We’re screwed; or not? I don’t know what to say to this really.
        Whatever the outcome is, all I can say is that we tried. We tried our
        hardest.
