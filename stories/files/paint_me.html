<h1>Paint me</h1>
<p dir="ltr">
    Dark autumn passes the greenlight over the poorest of souls. It is but
    without all doubts the time of a lifetime for brooding the sickest of minds
    to the healthiest of states.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    The landscape gives way to the roomiest of illuminated realities for a duo
    of people. There's nothing they can do to escape the reality of what they
    may come across.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Pass me that canvas won't you? It's high time to try and capture the
    stars.”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Of course”, he warmly smiles back. “Take an idea to the size?”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Pondering for a moment he contemplates but eventually settles on a most
    modest of certain views. There's more than enough of a place to invoke any
    individual feeling across its blank slate. They take up the brush and look
    sympathetically at what they have in front of them, if not for the sake of
    capturing the moment. Cramped, dirty and dingy — the room is run amuk with
    little space for thoughts.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Hard to come up with ideas? It's okay. Take your time.”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    They turn back around, brush in hand at him. What was the feeling? Did the
    paint opportune the sky above or the history of their life? Did there have
    to be a feeling, describable in its capacity? What did any of it have to
    truly mean?
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “I don't know. Do you have an idea?”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    He stares for a quiet moment, stirring only to try and point an idea only to
    come empty on the thought. After all, they weren't the artist but merely
    living through the space it provides.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    They felt a murmuring of their thoughts slightened only by the steady hum of
    the fan that oscillated back and forth, contrasting the otherwise
    emotionally barren place in time.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    They put the brush down into the cup of water that stood near the canvas. A
    slight stirring of the water came above but nothing that has significance.
    Why couldn't the idea pass if it felt so void in pure emotion?
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Let it be represented with something that has color in its moment but
    pursuant otherwise of minimal impact. Where the depths converge to make a
    moment that wouldn't ever be felt again. Let there be no more to the idea
    than just sensation itself but complete it with the actions that define you
    and the gaps complete in your mind. Can there be a moment without the tenure
    of the past building up what lives of the mind, wishes the humbled and
    beautifully sick. The leaves wash over the corpses of the then and the roots
    embowled in the hearts of the now.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Flowing with a deep vengeance, it turns to look back at what has been made
    so far. It frightens itself with what could be and wishes to rip it all
    away. Throwing the canvas down the brush is knocked out of the cup, water
    gushing out in a steady cadence only to slow as the volume slowly depletes.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    It throws the two onto the ground and lunges for the heart, grieving for but
    a chance to continue on the start of the journey. In a defenseless battle,
    the victor lies — depositing what control it wants onto the hands of the
    pitiful.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Don't you ever fucking think I won't find you again.”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Don't you ever fucking think, not for a second I won't know what you feel.”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Don't you ever fucking believe I won't realize your actions and your words
    rooted from the soul.”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    The apartment is but still evermore. All that stands is the towering figure
    of it's embrace and what little lies of the dignity in the process of
    creation. What blinds so in an indignant embrace to where it's but
    impossible to conclude, takes every sour moment and draws it into a figure
    unimaginably mistaken of before.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Throughout the littered room there are many attempts to capture, every time
    just a single moment more of little reality and of the wish to feel
    something different than the existing plan. To understand something of it
    all, and to feel embraced by a glow of light that dreads the cooling comfort
    of the steady rhythm.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    “Can you understand what it means?”
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    They nod contemplatively, unsure if it truly is what they know. He nods
    assuredly in the same step. What can it do that hasn't been done yet fears
    them to their core. What she knows that can't be told yet fears them to
    their core. What they have that can't be killed yet fears them to their
    core.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    The room is silent but again. Each looking back at a place ever comforted by
    the steady hum of the oscillating fan.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Forearm torn off the roots, their humanity slips of each passing second.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    As the sun comes to illuminate, there is only one visible to the passes
    above. Lying still, a dark velvet blotch claws for space with no second
    thought. There is nothing now but the silent drumming of the fan.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Filled with many attempts, nothing truly felt at ease.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    It's hard to paint without a moment.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
