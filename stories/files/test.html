<h1>Test.</h1>

    The leaves moved along with the flow of the wind; lusciously twisting and
    turning with every gust. The tree shook gently, as to affirm that it was
    sturdy and was not worried about taking risks. Then a car sped past; going
    nearish 50mph. The car slammed to a stop; sending a shock of wind around.
    The car halted and idled before it shut off and a man got out. The man was
    dressed in a casual fashion, he had blue denim jeans, a phone in one of the
    pockets, a shirt that said “Yeah, okay sure.” with a stain on the bottom
    right, and it had very few wrinkles. The man had a blank stare, shook his
    head, and slammed the door. He locked the door fumbling with the car keys.
    He took a gentle walk home, not worried and relieved; deprived of any sense
    of panic. He took out his house keys, turned them over until he found the
    key for the front door. A blast of light drowned him; igniting him in an
    illumination that was vibrant. His eyelids shut; arms around them to block
    out the blast of light in his eyes.

    “Well, this is home; I suppose,” Darin mumbled.

    His eyes darted around the house; he’d need to wash the fence, it had a lot
    of gunk and he couldn’t paint it over or it’d stick out. He shrugged his
    shoulders and turned the key when he stuck it in the lock. He opened the
    door, and a musty smell came over him. It felt damp, but smelt like
    humidity. He hadn’t come to his summer house in ages. The T.V. was circa
    2010ish, the Sony logo fading off and the Bravia logo covered in dust. The
    lamps all sat either fallen over or yellowed out. The house was a total dust
    town. He walked and the floor creaked slightly as he walked along. A
    discarded Domino’s pizza box lay next to the trash can. A PS3 sat next to
    the T.V. along with an Xbox 360. He looked around, eyes darting towards all
    the posters he had left up. Surprisingly, there was a phone left there. He
    picked it up, hands clasped around the case. It was a flip-phone with an
    incoming call.
