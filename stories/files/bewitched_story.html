    I went over to Proctors house and came  in through the doorway, Francis had
    come with me. I told em about how my wife was accused of witchcraft.
    Francis, began to say how his wife was accused too. He began defending how
    his wife wasn’t guilty. He spoke on about how pure his wife was. How she was
    brick of the church. I spoke bout how my wife were only reading books, not
    witchcraft. See here, she was accused due to the fact that she’d set a curse
    on somebody, the fact that their pigs would never live for more then 4 weeks
    cause she “bewitched” them. I know she’s never done anything of the sort. I
    knew that darned Walcott making a way to get his vengeance. I hear of
    Elizabeth charged of witchcraft, she charged of it from the poppet with a
    needle in it. I don’t recall who made it, was pondering on my wife. Away she
    went, in a wagon, I pray she ain’t hanged. Hale tell us a word on the
    happenings, the witchcraft. Said how a petty cause wouldn’t bother god and
    this witchcraft blaming be lied upon. I’d left lettin Proctor think on it.
    Maybe he will eh?
