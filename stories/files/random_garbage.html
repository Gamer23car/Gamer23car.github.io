    The biggest threat to the individual comes about in the form of noise,
    reducing their own thoughts into the solidarity of others in a combined
    belief of a concealed veil. In essence, the window cracks into a spiderweb
    of essence.

    Spotify AB ©’s CEO has gone on record to state their competitor does not lie
    with other companies or derived competition, but instead the “silence” that
    someone can end up in. Therefore, in a combined effort of proclaimed
    westernism and modernization: the person comes confronted with the noise of
    others and shudders back into an echo chamber of truth. No inescapable
    reality can derive from a place without a captor, and yet it remains ever
    clearer to whom this can apply once again. It's always the fault of the
    victim, and never that of the mere 1% of the population; the minority of
    immediate opinion and concerns. Look around the world, and the narrowing of
    that field to just the scape of a mere home can become deeply unsettling to
    many.

    When checking into the system filled by not just creators but other people
    in your life becomes compulsory, there is without a reasonable doubt it
    feels pressuring to go without the noise. To fill the gaps with the same
    elements as the rest comes across as the eventual outcome of what people
    desire and insurmountable.

    Web &amp; App services have been on a steady increase since the introduction
    of a developer-curated store front, deemed the App Store™ by Apple ©. When
    such a platform first came out, the mere bonding factor that came from just
    using these primitive yet fairly new platforms with continued demand itself
    became a new market. Holding the attention and willing nature for people to
    use products without restraint is the ultimate desire of anyone selling
    something. This, with grouped activity is what is the essential makeup of
    truly frictionless online consumerism and spending. With one of the world's
    greatest spending and most self-actualized base of population entangled
    inside the confines of what is but instant communication to others, buying
    impulse is extrapolated to greater deals. Searching for a good deal itself
    becomes more competitive, however it's arguable that the strengthened demand
    towards just purchasing increases the volume of want. On average, the
    greater demand of these things on mass has raised the average alongside the
    wish for these same companies to continue technological expansion to
    platform these spenders. This unchecked growth and continued demand means
    that there is without a doubt minimal ability for someone who is unwilling
    to participate to remain afloat in a marketplace of minimal effort. To each
    their own, and to smaller platforms, the presence of this choice comes at a
    greater detriment.

    No right or wrong comes from merely purchasing what is cheapest, but this
    constant reliance on the services provided by major corporations results in
    an increased ability to silently increase fees and pricing without much
    freedom of choice.

<p dir="ltr">
    These basic concepts of mind are easy to swallow, not a single person can
    truly find themselves solo or navigating a digital sphere without some form
    of friction.
